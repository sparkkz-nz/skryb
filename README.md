# skryb

Finally, your agent can produce beautiful documents that you can still edit
like Markdown.

skryb turns a portable HTML document containing Markdown, frontmatter, and
diagram source into readable documentation with interactive SVG flowcharts and
sequence diagrams. The Markdown source remains embedded in the HTML file, so a
document can be opened locally, edited, saved as a new copy, and reopened
without a server or build tool.

- **Fully Markdown compatible** - the canonical source stays in the file
- **Beautiful diagrams** with full control over layout and colour
- **A single portable HTML file** that needs only a browser
- **Built-in diagram editor** - no other tools needed
- **Easy for agents to write**, easy for humans to edit

See [the project page](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/) for a walkthrough
of source editing, the diagram editor, themes, and zoom.

skryb is a viewer for agent-generated documentation with targeted editing for
human corrections. It is not a general-purpose document authoring application.

Documents accept a CommonMark-style baseline: headings, nested lists, quotes,
thematic breaks, inline formatting, links, language-labelled code fences, and
tables. They also support GFM-style strikethrough and task lists. The
[syntax reference](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/docs/reference.html#markdown-compatibility) defines the exact
compatibility and safety rules, including literal raw HTML and permitted
link/image URLs.

## Start here

The fastest way to start by hand is to download
[the basic Skryb document template](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/templates/skryb-document-template.html).
Open it in a browser, use **Edit source** to replace its title, introductory
text, and flowchart, then choose **Save As** to create a new document.

To build a document from scratch, create an HTML file containing a `template#source`, a
`main#rendered-document`, and the hosted runtime:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Hello skryb</title>
  <script
    src="https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/latest/skryb-runtime.js"
    defer>
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <template id="source" type="text/markdown">
# Hello skryb

This document can be opened directly from your file system.
  </template>
  <main id="rendered-document"></main>
</body>
</html>
```

Save it as `hello-skryb.html` and open it in a browser. See the
[getting-started guide](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/docs/quickstart.html) for a diagram and editing
walkthrough, or the [syntax reference](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/docs/reference.html) for the complete
current document contract.

## Reading and editing

Everything happens inside the open document; there is no separate application.

- **Edit source** (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E) opens the source tray over the document. It
  holds the canonical Markdown and diagram YAML and live-renders valid changes.
  Drag the tray's top edge to resize it, or focus that edge and use the arrow
  keys; double-click it to restore the default height.
- **Diagram editing** selects a node to set its label, subtitle, shape, palette,
  status colour, fill, stroke, alignment, and size. Nodes can be dragged,
  resized, duplicated, and reconnected; every change is serialized back into the
  matching diagram fence.
- **Theme and colour scheme** are set in frontmatter or from the document menu:
  `theme` is `auto`, `light`, or `dark`, and `colourScheme` is `classic`, `ice`,
  `midnight`, or `paper`. Diagrams render as live SVG and follow the theme, and
  a menu change becomes canonical frontmatter when the document is saved.
- **Layout and zoom** switch the reading view between centred and full-width,
  and zoom, fit, or pan a diagram inside its frame. These are view controls:
  panning and zooming never alter stored coordinates. A diagram frame sizes
  itself to the drawn shapes on first render, so short diagrams leave no empty
  band; drag the frame's bottom edge to resize it, or press **Zoom to fit** to
  return to the automatic height.

## Runtime URLs

```html
<!-- Latest runtime from main: suitable for normal use and local experiments. -->
<script src="https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/latest/skryb-runtime.js" defer></script>

<!-- Immutable release snapshot: use for documents you publish or distribute. -->
<script src="https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/releases/v1.2.0/skryb-runtime.js" defer></script>

<!-- Shared branch build: use only for short-lived pre-merge testing. -->
<script src="https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/dev/skryb-runtime.js" defer></script>
```

Each push to `main` tests and publishes the latest runtime. A Git tag beginning
with `v` produces a retained, versioned snapshot. Each branch push updates the
shared development runtime, so documents must not rely on that URL after
testing.

For a document that must work without network access, choose **Save for
Offline**. It embeds the selected pinned runtime in the saved document; ordinary
**Save As** retains a hosted external runtime URL to keep source documents
small and portable between folders.

## Documentation

- [Getting started](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/docs/quickstart.html): create, open, edit, and save a
  portable document.
- [Syntax reference](https://sparkkz-nz.github.io/skryb/docs/reference.html): supported HTML, frontmatter, Markdown,
  flowchart and sequence diagram YAML, and editing behaviour.
- [Agent authoring skill](.github/skills/skryb-document/SKILL.md): instructions
  and checked examples for agents creating valid skryb documents.
- [Examples](examples/): ready-to-open hosted and local-runtime documents.

## Install the authoring skill

Install the `skryb-document` skill globally to make its schema-aware authoring
guidance available to every supported local agent:

```sh
npx skills add sparkkz-nz/skryb \
  --skill skryb-document \
  --agent '*' \
  --global \
  --yes \
  --full-depth
```

Omit `--global` to install it for only the current project. Keep the installed
skill current with:

```sh
npx skills update --global
```

The skill is versioned alongside the runtime. Use a release runtime URL for
published documents when you need a stable document contract.

## Development

[examples/web-runtime.html](examples/web-runtime.html) is the comprehensive
hosted-runtime demo. [examples/file-runtime.html](examples/file-runtime.html)
uses the runtime built at `dist/skryb-runtime.js`, so build first and keep the
example beside the repository's `dist/` directory. Install development
dependencies and run the runtime tests with:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
```

`npm test` builds and tests the minified browser artifact. Use `npm run check`
to type-check the TypeScript build entry independently.

## Licence

Skryb is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The built runtime carries a short attribution banner at the top of
`dist/skryb-runtime.js`. Because **Save As** inlines the runtime into the
document it produces, that banner travels with every saved document.

To keep single-file documents practical, the copyright holder grants an
additional permission: **retaining the banner comment in an inlined or
otherwise redistributed copy of the runtime satisfies the attribution and
licence-notice requirements of section 4 of the Apache License for that copy.**
Do not strip the banner. Redistributing Skryb's *source* remains subject to the
licence in full.

Documents you write with Skryb are yours. The licence covers Skryb itself, not
the content you author with it.
